This is the result of a project made during the course "Experimental Nuclear Reactor Kinetics" at the nuclear engineering master of science at Politecnico di Milano.
An analysis of TRIGA reactor through Serpent code was carried out, comparing numerical results with experimental ones. The investigation regards:
- neutron energy spectrum
- effective delayed neutron fraction
- control rod calibration curve
- reactivity feedback coefficients

The input file for Serpent and the final report are provided
